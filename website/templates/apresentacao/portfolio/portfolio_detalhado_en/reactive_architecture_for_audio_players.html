    <h3 class="h3_com_background">Online audio player</h3>

    <p>This is a project that, although it won't be published on the Play Store due to the potential risk of misuse by
        users and possible bureaucratic complications for me as the developer, is still a very interesting initiative
        that touches on some highly relevant topics.</p>

    <p>One of the main goals was to provide a great user experience. The app was designed to be practical and functional
        for everyday use, with an intuitive interface and smooth navigation. One of the most technically interesting
        aspects of the project is the state management of the audio libraries. I used <code>just_audio</code> and
        <code>audio_service </code>to enable efficient background playback.
    </p>

    <p>These libraries were integrated with Riverpod, ensuring that all widgets depending on the player state are
        updated synchronously and reactively, which contributes to the app’s overall stability and smoothness.</p>

    <p>Below, you'll find some images showcasing the project. I’m happy to share more details via email if you're
        interested.</p>

    <h3 class="h3_subtitle">Key Concepts Applied</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>State management using <code>Riverpod</code> as the core architecture</li>
        <li>Form validation across multiple user inputs</li>
        <li>Using SQLite as the local <code>database</code></li>
        <li>Page transitions implemented with <code>page_transition</code></li>
        <li>Visual feedback during network events using loading indicators and UI elements such as
            <code>ScaffoldMessenger</code>
        </li>
    </ul>
