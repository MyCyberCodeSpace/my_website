<div class="conteduo_detalhes_documentacao">
    <h3 class="h3_com_background">1. FlutterChat App</h3>

    <p>FlutterChat is a real-time messaging application that allows users to register using their email, name, and profile
        photo. After signing up, users are added to a shared chatroom where they can exchange messages instantly with
        all other participants. The app offers a smooth user experience with intuitive transitions and real-time
        updates.</p>

    <h3 class="h3_subtitle">Key Concepts Applied</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>User authentication and registration using <code>firebase_auth</code></li>
        <li>Form validation and error handling with <code>FirebaseAuthException</code> and
            <code>ScaffoldMessenger</code>
        </li>
        <li>Real-time database updates using <code>StreamBuilder</code> and <code>cloud_firestore</code></li>
        <li>Storage of user profile images via <code>firebase_storage</code> and image selection with
            <code>image_picker</code>
        </li>
        <li>Push notifications with Firebase Messaging</li>
        <li>Visual feedback during network events using loading indicators and UI transitions</li>
    </ul>

<div class="conteduo_detalhes_documentacao">
    <h3 class="h3_com_background">2. Favorite Places App</h3>

    <p>
        Favorite Places is a mobile application that allows users to save and revisit meaningful locations. Each saved
        place includes a name, photo, and precise location data. Users can either select their current GPS position or
        tap directly on the map to set a custom location. The app also retrieves the complete address (street, city,
        state, country) using geolocation services. All data is stored locally on the device, ensuring offline access to
        saved locations.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3_subtitle">Key Concepts Applied</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Local data persistence using <code>sqflite</code></li>
        <li>State management with <code>flutter_riverpod</code></li>
        <li>Map rendering and interaction using <code>flutter_map</code> and <code>latlong2</code></li>
        <li>Address resolution via reverse geocoding with <code>geocoding</code></li>
        <li>User-selected location via map tapping or GPS detection</li>
        <li>Image input and storage for visual reference of locations</li>
    </ul>

<div class="conteduo_detalhes_documentacao">

    <h3 class="h3_com_background">3. Grocery List App</h3>

    <p>
        Grocery List is a cloud-synced application that enables users to manage their grocery items in a clean,
        minimalist interface. Users can quickly add products, assign them to predefined categories, and remove them with
        intuitive swipe gestures. All data is stored and retrieved through Firebase Realtime Database via RESTful HTTP
        requests, allowing persistent access and cross-device syncing.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3_subtitle">Key Concepts Applied</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cloud data persistence using <code>Firebase Realtime Database</code> via REST API</li>
        <li>HTTP request handling, including status code verification and JSON serialization</li>
        <li>Interactive UI with swipe-to-delete functionality</li>
        <li>Dynamic list building and filtering by predefined categories</li>
        <li>Minimalist UX with focus on fast, accessible input</li>
    </ul>

<div class="conteduo_detalhes_documentacao">
    <h3 class="h3_com_background">4. Recipes Explorer App</h3>

    <p>
        Recipes Explorer is a recipe browsing application that organizes meals into well-defined categories. Users can
        navigate through categories, view detailed recipes, and save their favorites for quick access. A side navigation
        menu provides advanced filtering options based on dietary preferences, such as gluten-free, lactose-free,
        vegetarian, or vegan. The app emphasizes intuitive navigation and visual transitions to enhance the user
        experience.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3_subtitle">Key Concepts Applied</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>State management across filters, favorites, and UI controls using <code>flutter_riverpod</code></li>
        <li>Category-based recipe organization with nested navigation via <code>Navigator</code></li>
        <li>Use of key UI widgets: <code>Drawer</code> for side menu, <code>InkWell</code> for interaction,
            <code>Stack</code> for layout composition
        </li>
        <li>Smooth image transitions and animations using <code>FadeInImage</code> and <code>Hero</code></li>
        <li>User feedback provided via <code>SnackBar</code> notifications</li>
        <li>Session-based favorites (no persistent storage)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Considerations</h2>

    <p>
        Beyond what is described above, it is important to note that several additional widgets, techniques, and design
        patterns were used throughout these applications. Other apps were also developed beyond the ones listed here.
        However, this portfolio offers a solid overview of the core concepts and pillars of mobile development with
        Flutter.

    <p>
        I have chosen not to share the source code for these projects out of respect for the original course authorship.
        Although the implementations reflect my understanding and improvements, they were based on guided educational
        material.
        The only exception is the location app, where I intentionally
        deviated from the suggested Google Maps API to use <code>flutter_map</code>
        as a more cost-effective and open-source
        alternative.
